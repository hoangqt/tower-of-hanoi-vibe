# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Towers of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle game where players must move a stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules. This project will create an interactive web-based version of the game with a JavaScript UI that provides visual feedback, game controls, and educational features to help users understand and enjoy this timeless puzzle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a visual representation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, so that I can understand the current game state and plan my moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display three vertical rods/towers
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a configurable number of disks (default 3) stacked on the leftmost rod
3. WHEN displaying disks THEN the system SHALL render each disk with a different size, with larger disks at the bottom
4. WHEN displaying disks THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors or visual patterns for each disk to make them easily distinguishable
5. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to move disks between rods using mouse interactions, so that I can play the game intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a disk THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected disk if it's the topmost disk on its rod
2. WHEN I click on a rod THEN the system SHALL move the selected disk to that rod if the move is valid
3. WHEN I attempt an invalid move THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the move is not allowed
4. WHEN I click on an empty area THEN the system SHALL deselect any currently selected disk
5. WHEN a disk is being moved THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animation transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to enforce the rules of Towers of Hanoi, so that I can only make valid moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to move a disk THEN the system SHALL only allow moving the topmost disk from a rod
2. WHEN I attempt to place a disk THEN the system SHALL only allow placement on an empty rod or on top of a larger disk
3. WHEN I attempt an invalid move THEN the system SHALL prevent the move and display an error message
4. WHEN all disks are moved to the rightmost rod in the correct order THEN the system SHALL detect the win condition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to track my progress and performance, so that I can see how well I'm doing and improve my skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a new game THEN the system SHALL initialize a move counter to zero
2. WHEN I make a valid move THEN the system SHALL increment the move counter
3. WHEN I complete the puzzle THEN the system SHALL display my total number of moves
4. WHEN I complete the puzzle THEN the system SHALL display the optimal number of moves for comparison
5. WHEN I complete the puzzle THEN the system SHALL calculate and display my efficiency percentage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize the game difficulty, so that I can challenge myself appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access game settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to select the number of disks (3-8 disks)
2. WHEN I change the number of disks THEN the system SHALL reset the game with the new configuration
3. WHEN I select more disks THEN the system SHALL adjust the visual layout to accommodate all disks
4. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display the minimum number of moves required for the current configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want game control options, so that I can manage my gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to start over THEN the system SHALL provide a "Reset" button that restarts the current game
2. WHEN I want to undo a mistake THEN the system SHALL provide an "Undo" button that reverses the last move
3. WHEN I want to see the solution THEN the system SHALL provide a "Solve" button that demonstrates the optimal solution
4. WHEN the auto-solve is running THEN the system SHALL provide a "Pause/Resume" button to control the demonstration
5. WHEN I pause the auto-solve THEN the system SHALL allow me to continue playing manually from that point

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want helpful feedback and guidance, so that I can learn and improve my problem-solving skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a disk THEN the system SHALL highlight valid destination rods
2. WHEN I make my first move THEN the system SHALL provide brief instructions on how to play
3. WHEN I'm stuck for an extended period THEN the system SHALL offer a hint for the next optimal move
4. WHEN I complete the puzzle THEN the system SHALL provide encouraging feedback and performance summary
5. WHEN I achieve the optimal solution THEN the system SHALL provide special recognition

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to work well on different devices, so that I can play on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the game on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
2. WHEN I use a touch device THEN the system SHALL support touch interactions for selecting and moving disks
3. WHEN I use a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide appropriately sized touch targets
4. WHEN I rotate my mobile device THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout for the new orientation
5. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support arrow keys and enter for accessibility
